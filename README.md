# Grey Seal Project
This the final exam/project for the module Machine Learning in the Higher Diploma in Data analytics delivered by ATU.

Dataset – Background:
The dataset provided for this project is private to ATU. **It must not be shared with any entity or individual outside ATU.**
 The dataset originates from a European-funded project conducted by the MFRC (Marine and Freshwater Research Centre) in ATU. The dataset comprises underwater recordings taken by devices deployed by the Celtic Voyager Research Vessel in the Malin Sea. You may read further details on the data collection process and rationale here: Static Acoustic Monitoring of Harbour (Phoca vitulina) and Grey Seals (Halichoerus grypus) in the Malin Sea: A Revolutionary Approach in Pinniped Conservation . This MFRC-led conservation project aims to collect data on grey seals to learn more about their populations and behaviour. Currently many seal (pinniped) populations are declining due to the effects of climate change and noise from offshore windfarms and shipping. The MFRC research aims to better understand these effects.

# How to set up a virtual environment in Visual Studio Code.
- Make a new file.
- In the terminal input the command:
    python -m venv venv
- Activate the virtal  environment:
    venv\Scripts\activate
- If successful (venv) will be on the terminal line
- 

 # Notebook 1:
The provided dataset consists of long, uncompressed .wav recordings of grey seal vocalisations. These recordings contain extended periods of background noise interspersed with relatively short vocal calls. As a result, the raw audio files are unsuitable for direct use in machine learning models without prior preprocessing. The objective of this notebook is to prepare the data for Machine Learning.
The code basis for this notebook is the code given in Spectogram.ipynb.

# Notebook2old:
This is the original notebook 2. I was unable to run the packages on this so I commenced a new Notebook2 which is part of the project.

# Notebook 2:
This notebook was run in a virtual environment as set up above.
